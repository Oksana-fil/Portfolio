# Portfolio
My portfolio as QA engineer. This project contains the main sections of my theoretical and practical knowledge of testing. On this page your can find examples of testing by levels and types, main techniques of testing and docmentation. Also, there are some examples data base testing by SQL and API testing by Postman. And, my CV is presented as a web page that was created by using HTML and CSS.
I learned everything presented above by course of QA tester, my work and by diging into subjects by myself. It would be glad for me if your find something interesting anf helpfull for yourself.
